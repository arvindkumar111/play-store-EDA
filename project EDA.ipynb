The analysis combines app-level attributes (category, rating, reviews, installs, price, size, content rating, genres, last updated, Android version) with review text and sentiment signals to characterize distributions, data quality, and inter-variable associations that shape market structure and user-perceived quality.\n","\n","The pipeline begins with rigorous data quality checks and standardization. Key steps include parsing and normalizing installs (removing “+” and commas, casting to integers), prices (stripping currency symbols), and sizes (harmonizing MB/KB and “Varies with device”), plus de-duplicating app entries and addressing missing ratings. Outlier detection flags extreme values in reviews, installs, and size, while date parsing enables recency features (days since last update). Separate profiling of the reviews dataset inspects nulls, language or encoding anomalies, and class balance in sentiment labels if present.\n","\n","Univariate exploration reveals skewed distributions across engagement and popularity metrics. Installs and reviews exhibit heavy right-skew with long tails, necessitating log-scale perspectives for interpretability. Ratings cluster between 3.5 and 4.7 with thinner mass at extremes, and missing ratings are non-randomly distributed across smaller or newer apps. Size shows multimodality due to games and media-heavy categories. Category-level counts confirm the dominance of Games, Productivity, Tools, Communication, and Education in app supply, with variability in median rating and typical size by category.\n","\n","Bivariate analysis characterizes core relationships. Reviews and installs show a strong monotonic association on log scales, consistent with social proof dynamics; scatterplots and correlation matrices confirm this relationship while highlighting heteroskedasticity at the high-install range. Price relates inversely to installs, with free/freemium clusters significantly outnumbering paid. App size shows weak to moderate association with lower rating in some categories, likely reflecting performance and resource constraints; however, this association attenuates when controlling for category. Recency of update correlates positively with rating and review volume in many segments, visible in grouped boxplots by update age buckets.\n","\n","Segmented EDA uncovers category-specific nuances. Games and Entertainment have higher variance in both rating and size; Productivity and Tools show more compact rating distributions with mid-to-high medians; Finance and Health often have higher recency of updates and tighter size budgets. Content rating segmentation (Everyone, Teen, Mature) indicates differing install patterns and rating spreads, suggesting audience-driven expectations around ads, UX, and stability. For paid apps, median installs are markedly lower, but median rating can be stable or slightly higher in niche categories, indicating value perception effects.\n","\n","Reviews EDA focuses on high-level sentiment and themes without modeling. Summary statistics of polarity or basic lexicons reveal that negative feedback frequently clusters around crashes, latency, battery usage, intrusive ads, and gated features; positive feedback highlights ease of use, clean UI, and reliable performance. Time-sliced sentiment distributions show sensitivity to updates and release cycles, and apps with consistent recent positive reviews tend to maintain higher contemporaneous ratings. Word-frequency and bigram exploration identifies recurrent topics per category, linking common pain points (e.g., ads in casual games, login issues in finance, sync reliability in productivity) to observed rating dispersion.\n","\n","Together, the EDA establishes a descriptive baseline: the Play Store follows a power-law landscape with concentrated success, ratings are moderately high but sensitive to operational quality, and engagement proxies (reviews and installs) co-move strongly while being moderated by price, category, size, and update recency. These findings, derived purely from profiling and visualization, frame hypotheses for subsequent modeling and guide where deeper causal or predictive analyses would be most informative. If desired, this EDA can be extended with robust outlier treatment, seasonality-aware trend charts for reviews, and stratified comparisons across app age cohorts to further refine descriptive insights.\n","\n","\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"F6v_1wHtG2nS"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# **GitHub Link -**"],"metadata":{"id":"w6K7xa23Elo4"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Provide your GitHub Link here."],"metadata":{"id":"h1o69JH3Eqqn"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# **Problem Statement**\n"],"metadata":{"id":"yQaldy8SH6Dl"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["**Write Problem Statement Here.**"],"metadata":{"id":"DpeJGUA3kjGy"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["#### **Define Your Business Objective?**"],"metadata":{"id":"PH-0ReGfmX4f"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["The Play Store apps data has enormous potential to drive app-making businesses to success.
